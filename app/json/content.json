However, after completing internships in the fields of business and education, I earned my degree with a focus in Human Resources. I then pursued graduate studies in education, and in 1998, began my career in higher education as an academic advisor for the University at Buffalo. I first served as an advisor for underrepresented (African American, Hispanic and Native American) student populations. In 2000, I moved into the position of Pre-Law Advisor and developed the Pre-Law Student Services Center. In 2003, I was promoted to Assistant Director of Student Advising Services. In 2008, I was appointed as the Director of Academic Advisement and Student Advising Services. I tremendously enjoy working at the university and providing guidance to students as they pursue their academic and career goals.",

Instead I happily focused on College Student Development, which has led me to Student Advising Services.

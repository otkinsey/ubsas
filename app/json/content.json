        "academicPath":"I entered UB as an intended business (Marketing) major with the desire to pursue a career as a buyer for a large retail organization (Women's Fashions). However, after completing internships in the fields of business and education, I earned my degree with a focus in Human Resources. I then pursued graduate studies in education, and in 1998, began my career in higher education as an academic advisor for the University at Buffalo. I first served as an advisor for underrepresented (African American, Hispanic and Native American) student populations. In 2000, I moved into the position of Pre-Law Advisor and developed the Pre-Law Student Services Center. In 2003, I was promoted to Assistant Director of Student Advising Services. In 2008, I was appointed as the Director of Academic Advisement and Student Advising Services. I tremendously enjoy working at the university and providing guidance to students as they pursue their academic and career goals.",

I was not sure I could go back to school after 30 years, but I did. I began taking one class a semester starting in the fall of 2009 and obtained my B.A. in Sociology in the summer of 2014.",

These careers were prevented by motion sickness and a dislike for constant, overwhelming mathematics. By high school graduation I decided upon psychology because I find humankind's thoughts and behaviors so intriguing. My desire was to earn my Ph.D. in Neurobiology and perform research on male and female brain differences. Instead I happily focused on College Student Development, which has led me to Student Advising Services. I believe everyone has a mixture of gifts, talents, and skills they can combine to find true happiness in their niche in society and my mixture has led me to student advising.",
